- **Inventory GUI refactor:** Removed redundant `BotInventoryScreen.java`, introduced the canonical `BotInventoryScreen` in `GraphicalUserInterface`, and updated `AIPlayerClient` to register it as the bot inventory UI.
- **Build stability:** Fixed duplicate-class and rendering-related compilation errors that were blocking builds. The bot inventory currently uses a solid background as a temporary workaround for the previous texture issue.
- **Docs:** Updated `file_index.md` to reflect the current project structure and to include the new `BotInventoryScreen` location.
- **Mining safety:** Bots now detect when they spawn or tunnel into solid blocks, automatically dig themselves out with the best tool available, and broadcast "I'm suffocating!" if they only have bare hands so players can teleport them to safety. The experimental stair-step planner has been disabled for now so teleport-off mining proceeds with the proven approach while we revisit depth-targeting later.
- **Depth mining:** `/bot skill mining depth <y>` now drives the bot to the requested Y-level by carving offset stair steps (never straight down), and the new optional `stairs` flag lets you opt into the experimental spiral planner per job. Depth runs also halt with a “Hit water” warning if the bot digs into a flooded shaft so you can come block it off.
- **Spawn/claustrophobia safety:** Bots now call the dig-out routine whenever the collision box reports suffocation or the bot just took head damage, so even teleport-enabled spawns won’t sit inside stone. The chat alert remains so you can teleport if they only have fists.
- **Depth water handling:** Depth runs only pause once the bot actually touches water (feet/head submerged). This avoids premature aborts while still warning you to block the flood.
- **Next up:** teach bots to place blocks to plug detected water, re-enable the spiral stair planner by default once it survives more testing, and explore automated lantern placement so deep shafts aren’t pitch black.
- **Hazard controls:** Mining now pauses whenever water, lava, or a full inventory threaten the bot; each pause explains the cause, flags the job for manual resumption, and tells you to run `/bot resume <alias>`. A new `/bot config inventoryFullPause` toggle governs the latter, and `/bot resume` (plus the matching SkillResumeService support) lets you restart the last skill when it is safe again.
- **Stripmine skill:** `/bot skill stripmine <length>` cuts a 1×3 tunnel straight ahead, respecting vanilla reach and pausing when hazards (lava, water, drops, chests, mineshafts, or rare ores) are detected. Hazards broadcast a chat warning and require `/bot resume` once cleared.
- **Spiral depth mode:** The optional `spiral` modifier now keeps stair shafts tight, enforces a 4-block ceiling so decorative stairs can be added later, and inherits all hazard checks from the rest of the mining toolkit.
- **Hazard detector:** Chest, ore, structure, and precipice detection is shared across every block-breaking skill so they all stop safely with a warning instead of tunnelling blindly into danger.
